# Synopsis

The Casket Diaries is a poignant and deeply emotional journey through love, grief, addiction, and the fragile hope that lingers in the spaces between heartbreaks. Set in the quiet towns and sprawling landscapes of Michigan, the story follows Greg Reeves and Sadie Grey, two souls whose paths intertwine in the most unexpected of places—a bookstore parking lot.

Greg, a musician with restless hands and a past he's always running from, meets Sadie, a woman who sees beauty in the broken. Together, they forge a love that burns fiercely, built on whispered promises and the belief that love alone can keep them whole. But life has other plans. As tragedy strikes, their relationship is tested in ways neither could have imagined, forcing them to confront the parts of themselves they've long buried—Greg's struggles with addiction, Sadie's fear of repeating the past, and the ghosts of the life they once envisioned.

Through years of love and loss, separation and reunion, The Casket Diaries explores whether some loves are destined to endure, or if they are simply echoes of what could have been. Is love enough to mend what's been broken? Or do some stories end in silence, leaving only the lingering resonance of what was?

With lyrical prose and hauntingly intimate storytelling, The Casket Diaries captures the essence of human fragility and resilience, weaving a tale that lingers long after the final page.
