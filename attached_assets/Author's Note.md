# Author's Note

When I first started The Casket Diaries back in 2019, it wasn't a novel—it was music. It was the name of my band, the title under which I poured out hundreds of songs, each one a raw, unfiltered journal entry. It was messy, angry, and unhinged. It was my story—but only one side of it.

By 2021, The Casket Diaries had shifted into a journal and blog, a place where I continued to process my experiences. And yet, something still felt incomplete. No matter how many times I reshaped it, I couldn't seem to let go of this project. It kept evolving, changing forms, refusing to settle into something final. It wasn't until early 2024 that I truly understood why.

For years, I had been telling my story as a singular narrative—one voice, one perspective. I had cast myself as the victim, as the hero, as the only one who truly felt the weight of it all. But life, love, grief, and redemption don't work that way. They are never just one-sided.

That's when I realized that The Casket Diaries had to be something more. It couldn't just be a journal. It couldn't just be a song. It had to be both—a novel that captured not just my story, but the stories of everyone involved. So, I wrote it. From the beginning. From childhood to mid-life, from heartbreak to healing.

But I didn't stop there. The same way The Casket Diaries began as music, I knew it needed to end with music too. I wrote songs for each chapter, capturing the emotions of both Greg and Sadie—their perspectives as individuals, their voices entwined. Some songs are his. Some are hers. Some belong to them both.

It has been an exhausting, relentless journey—one I could never seem to walk away from, no matter how many times I tried. And now, it's finished. Even if I am the only one who ever loves this project, it is something I will forever be proud of.

This story is fiction, but it is also not.
