# Ghost in the Sun

I wear sunshine like a borrowed dress, a smile stitched onto my face
But beneath the surface, a hollow space, where love couldn't find its place
You speak of forever, of a love that knows no end
But my heart beats a different rhythm, a language I can't comprehend

My history whispers in the silence, a tangled symphony of doubt
How can I trust in forever, when forever always burned out?

I'm a ghost in the sun, searching for a shadow to hide
Lost in a world of warmth, where I can't seem to reside
You offer me constellations, promises written in the stars
But my eyes are fixed on the darkness, the wreckage of who we are

I see your love like a fragile bird, with wings spread open wide
But my instinct is to cage it, protect it from the tide
Of my own self-destruction, the patterns that repeat
I sabotage the beauty, before it's swept off of its feet

You tell me I'm worthy, but the words fall on deaf ears
Haunted by the echoes, of a past consumed by fears

I'm a ghost in the sun, searching for a shadow to hide
Lost in a world of warmth, where I can't seem to reside
You offer me constellations, promises written in the stars
But my eyes are fixed on the darkness, the wreckage of who we are

I'm tangled in the wreckage, of a love I never learned
A kaleidoscope of fractured pieces, a lesson never earned
How do you love a ghost, who's tethered to the night?
How do you mend a broken wing, and teach it how to take flight?

I'm a ghost in the sun, trying to embrace the light
But the darkness keeps calling, a familiar, comforting sight
You offer me a sunrise, a future painted gold
But I'm clinging to the remnants, of a story left untold
