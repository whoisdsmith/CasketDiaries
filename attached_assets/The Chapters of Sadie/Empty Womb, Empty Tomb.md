# Empty Womb, Empty Tomb

Cemetery Weather hangs heavy in the air, a chill that settles in my bones
Another visit, another prayer, another bouquet of wilted stones
The world keeps spinning, seasons change, but time stands still for me
Trapped in this endless loop of grief, since the day you ceased to be

Life's biggest lie, they tell you there's someone out there for you
Eight billion souls to choose from, a love that sees you through
But what if the one you thought was meant to be, was only there for the good?
What if the bad parts of you are left alone, misunderstood?

I see your face in every cloud, hear your laughter in the rain
But it's just a cruel reminder, of a love I can't reclaim

Cemetery Weather, a constant, chilling rain
Washing away the memories, leaving only the pain
The earth beneath my feet feels cold, as cold as my empty womb
My heart a shattered Porcelain doll, lying broken in this tomb

The nights are long, the silence screams, filled with what ifs and whys
I close my eyes, but all I see, is the look in your lifeless eyes
The blessing that didn't come through, the child we both created
Never got to really live, a future devastated

I'm left with the echoes of your heartbeat, a ghostly lullaby
The nights I stay up crying, wondering why, oh why, did you have to die?
I blame myself, I should've done something differently, they say
But no one understands, the burden I carry every day

These late nights when I can't find a reason to smile
I need someone the most, but you're not here, not for a while

Cemetery Weather, a constant, chilling rain
Washing away the memories, leaving only the pain
The earth beneath my feet feels cold, as cold as my empty womb
My heart a shattered Porcelain doll, lying broken in this tomb

I regret letting myself infect your life, with the sickness in my soul
Wishing I could go back, make you whole, let your story unfold
Without the shadow of my pain, without the weight of my past
Maybe then you would have lived, your love would have truly last

Cemetery Weather, a constant, chilling rain
Washing away the memories, leaving only the pain
The earth beneath my feet feels cold, as cold as my empty womb
My heart a shattered Porcelain doll, lying broken in this tomb
