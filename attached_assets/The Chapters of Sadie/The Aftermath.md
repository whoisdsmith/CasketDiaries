# The Aftermath

The silence in this house is deafening, since you walked out that door
I keep expecting you to call, to say you're coming back for more
But the phone stays silent, just like my broken heart
Trying to find the pieces, and make a brand-new start

The echoes of our laughter, now just haunt these empty halls
Fading photographs on the wall, a memory that falls
Like shattered glass, around my feet, a love that couldn't last
I'm left with the wreckage of our life, a ghost of a love that couldn't last, a future in the past

I replay every word, every touch, every tear
Trying to understand, how we ended up here
The blame, the guilt, the sorrow, a heavy weight to bear
And I'm drowning in the silence, gasping for air

This is the aftermath, the calm after the storm
Picking up the pieces, of a life that's torn
Trying to find my way, in this new, unfamiliar land
With a heart full of regret, and the strength to take a stand

The kids ask for you, in their innocent way
And I try to explain, why you couldn't stay
How do I tell them, that love can sometimes break?
That even the strongest bonds, can crumble and ache?

I see your face in the lines on their hands, in the way they smile
A bittersweet reminder, of a love that lasted for a while
And I wonder if you think of us, if you feel the pain too
Or if you've moved on already, like I'm trying to do

I replay every word, every touch, every tear
Trying to understand, how we ended up here
The blame, the guilt, the sorrow, a heavy weight to bear
And I'm drowning in the silence, gasping for air

This is the aftermath, the calm after the storm
Picking up the pieces, of a life that's torn
Trying to find my way, in this new, unfamiliar land
With a heart full of regret, and the strength to take a stand

I know I played a part, in the breaking of our home
I let the shadows in, and I let the darkness roam
But I'm learning to forgive myself, for the mistakes I've made
And I'm finding my own strength, in the choices I have laid.
The echoes of the past, still whisper in my ear.
But I won't let them hold me, I won't live in fear.

This is the aftermath, the calm after the storm
Picking up the pieces, of a life that's torn
Trying to find my way, in this new, unfamiliar land
With a heart full of regret, and the strength to take a stand

The road ahead is long, and the path is unclear
But I'll keep moving forward, and I'll face my fear
I'll learn to navigate this world, without you by my side
I'll find the strength within myself, to turn the rising tide
And maybe someday, the sun will shine again, and I'll find peace in the aftermath of pain
