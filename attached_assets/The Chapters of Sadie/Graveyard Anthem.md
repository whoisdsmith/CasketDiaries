# Graveyard Anthem

Another town, another name, another face in the crowd
Same story, different chapter, screaming out loud
Running from the ghosts, the echoes in my head
The broken promises I made, the words I left unsaid

Cemetery Weather follows me, a storm I can't outrun
This runaway heart, beats to a rhythm, a love that's come undone

This is my Graveyard Anthem, a love song for the lost
Another shot of courage, another bridge I've crossed
I'm a master of escape, a queen of second chances
But the truth is, I'm a prisoner, trapped in my own dances

They tell me I'm a hurricane, leaving wreckage in my wake
A trail of broken hearts, a love I couldn't make
But I don't see the damage, I don't hear the cries
Just the whisper of another life, a chance to say goodbye

Cemetery Weather chills my bones, a reminder of the past
Another life, another dream, a love that couldn't last

This is my Graveyard Anthem, a love song for the lost
Another shot of courage, another bridge I've crossed
I'm a master of escape, a queen of second chances
But the truth is, I'm a prisoner, trapped in my own dances

Barnes & Noble parking lot, Yellowcard on repeat
A memory of innocence, a love bittersweet
But the girl in the rearview mirror, she's a stranger to my eyes
Lost in the Graveyard Anthem, where another love dies

This is my Graveyard Anthem!
This is my Graveyard Anthem!
