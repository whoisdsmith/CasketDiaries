# Rearview Reflections

Taillights blur, a ribbon unwinding, miles melt away
Each town a faded Polaroid, a bittersweet yesterday
Barnes & Noble, that November chill, a love's first sweet trace
Miles melt away, but the ghost still stays, a coldness in this place.

Gray Yellowcard shirt, your nervous laugh, in that falling snow
Barnes & Noble, a memory warm, a love I used to know
But the faded Polaroid's a ghost now, hauntin' every frame
Each mile a memory, each town a ghost, whispering your name.

The road keeps winding, but it always leads me back
Can't outrun the darkness, the ghosts on the attack.

Rearview reflections, not just towns, but memories I see
Chasing a ghost, a love that couldn't be
The rain keeps falling, washing over my past
Lost in the rearview, a future fading fast.

Engine sputtering, like a heart about to break
No more distractions, no more escapes to make
Forced to stop, forced to confront what I've denied
Alone on the roadside, with the ghosts I can't forsake.

The faces in the rearview, they're not just towns, they're me
The monster's taking shape, for all the world to see
Shattered reflections, the girl I used to be
Maybe the monster is just a part of me.

No more running, no more hiding in the rearview's haze
Facing the reflections, embracing the pain and the days.

The ghosts in the mirror, they're showing me the way
No more chasing shadows, no more running away
The rain may be falling, but I'm finding my own light today
The girl in the rearview, she's finally here to stay.

Looking back now, would we change what we had?
That fragile love, the promises, both good and bad?
Barnes & Noble, the chill of November's embrace,
The faded Polaroid, the love lost without a trace?
But the past can't be rewritten, only understood,
The pain of losing you, a burden ill-construed
Forgiveness starts within, a healing starts to bloom
The road ahead is long, but I'm not afraid to drive alone today.
