# Fading Blue Paint

Fading blue paint, peeling on the porch swing
Six years old, and my heart already knows the sting
Of broken promises, whispered in the night
Mama's love, a flickering candle, losing its light

The air hangs heavy, with cigarette smoke and despair
Another fight, another slammed door, another unanswered prayer
Eight hungry mouths to feed, eight souls to try and mend
But the cracks in our foundation, just keep on extending

Fading blue paint, on a house that couldn't hold
The weight of our secrets, the stories left untold
A childhood painted in shades of gray
Where dreams took flight, but love always strayed

Cassie, my twin, my mirror, my only saving grace
We held onto each other, in this forgotten place
Two hearts beating as one, against the rhythm of despair
Sharing secrets in whispers, on a threadbare, worn-out stair

Strangers in uniforms, at our doorstep one day
Took us away from the chaos, but a part of me wanted to stay
In that broken-down house, with its fading blue paint
Where love was a burden, and hope felt so faint

Fading blue paint, on a house that couldn't hold
The weight of our secrets, the stories left untold
A childhood painted in shades of gray
Where dreams took flight, but love always strayed

Foster care, a stranger's touch, a new kind of fear
But kindness found us, wiped away every tear
They showed us a world, where families held tight
Where love wasn't a battle, fought in the dead of night

Fading blue paint, on a house that couldn't hold
The weight of our secrets, the stories left untold
A childhood painted in shades of gray
Where dreams took flight, but love always strayed
