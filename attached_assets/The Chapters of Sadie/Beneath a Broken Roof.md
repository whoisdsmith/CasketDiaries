# Beneath a Broken Roof

Eight years old, beneath a roof that leaked with every rain
A symphony of chaos, a constant, dull ache of pain
Cigarette smoke and whispers, a house bursting at the seams
Longing for a silence, in a world of broken dreams

Dishes piled high, a mother's weary sigh
A tapestry of hand-me-downs, beneath a fading sky

We were weeds in a garden, growing wild and untamed
Each a melody of longing, never quite the same
Beneath a broken roof, we danced to a broken song
Searching for a love, that never quite belonged

My twin sister, Cassie, with fire in her eyes
She navigated the chaos, with a strength I couldn't disguise
I envied her spirit, her laughter in the storm
While I craved a quiet corner, a haven safe and warm

My friend Gracie's house, a world so serene
A picture of perfection, a life I'd never seen

We were weeds in a garden, growing wild and untamed
Each a melody of longing, never quite the same
Beneath a broken roof, we danced to a broken song
Searching for a love, that never quite belonged

In the small room we shared, whispers in the night
"I hate this house," I'd say, with all my childish might
"At least we're all together," Cassie would reply
But the loneliness within me, was a truth I couldn't deny

We were weeds in a garden, growing wild and untamed
Each a melody of longing, never quite the same
Beneath a broken roof, we danced to a broken song
Searching for a love, that never quite belonged
