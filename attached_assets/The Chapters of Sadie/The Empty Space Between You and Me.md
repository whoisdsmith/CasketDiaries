# The Empty Space Between You and Me

I watch you from across this empty room,
You're miles away, but I'm so close to you.
My heart is heavy, tied down with doubt,
Wonderin' if I'm worth it or if I'm wearing out.

Used to be we'd laugh until we cried,
Now silence is the place we hide.
I reach out, but it slips away,
Fading like the light at the end of day.

Where are we going, now that we're here?
Lost in the space between hope and fear.
Once, we couldn't stand a single inch apart,
Now I'm just someone you're learning to guard.
Where are we going, and where did we start?

I miss the nights when nothing mattered more
Than being so close, breathing in each other's warmth.
You were my reason, my steady ground,
But now I feel like I let you down.

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's me,
A shadow of what I used to be.
I know you blame me, you don't have to say,
But I never thought it'd end this way.

Where are we going, now that we're here?
Caught in the echoes of love we can't hear.
Used to be I'd find myself in your eyes,
Now I'm just lost in the silent goodbyes.
Where are we going, what did we leave behind?

They say love fades, but I didn't believe,
Thought we were different, thought we could see.
Now I'm just reaching for pieces of you,
Wonderin' if we can make it through.
Do you remember when you needed me close?
When every heartbeat was one we chose?
I'm still that person, buried deep,
But where are you when I try to speak?

Where are we going, now that we're here?
Wrapped in the shadows of all our fear.
We had it once, a fire so bright,
Now it's just embers, swallowed by night.
Where are we going, will we ever find our way back?

I never wanted it to end like this,
Caught between broken promises and faded bliss.
I'll hold on to the memory, the touch of your hand,
But I wonder, will we ever stand.
Together again, like we used to be?
Or are we just two souls, drifting out to sea?
Where are we going, now that we're here,
Drowning in a love we can barely feel.
