# Until The Last Light Fades

When you know, you know. There are no doubts, no second guessing, no confusion.

It's something rare when you look at someone the same way they look at you
and it's even better when they want the same things that you do.

I've been in love with you since the day I met you
in the Barnes & Noble parking lot back in 2011.
I've never pictured a future that didn't have you in it.
I want the same things that you want,
Our goal in this relationship is the same, I'm just a little more patient.

I know things are never going to be perfect
and life has dealt us some pretty shitty hands,
but I am still here. I will always be here.
You are all the things that I love, that I have ever wanted.

I will never let you go. I will never stop fighting for you.

Remember we said we'd be buried together in the cemetery weather?

No need for reminding, you're still all that matters to me
