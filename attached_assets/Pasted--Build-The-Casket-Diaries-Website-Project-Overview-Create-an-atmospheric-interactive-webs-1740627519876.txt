# Build "The Casket Diaries" Website

## Project Overview
Create an atmospheric, interactive website for "The Casket Diaries" that embodies the concept "Eternal Embers Through Cemetery Weather." The site should evoke powerful emotions through a dark, moody aesthetic with glowing ember elements, representing enduring love amidst darkness. This is a storytelling experience that takes visitors on an emotional journey through different sections, each with its own visual signature while maintaining cohesive design language.

## Core Visual Design

### Background System (Three Layers)
1. **Base Layer**: Create a deep, dark backdrop representing "cemetery weather" that subtly shifts between environmental states (gentle rain animation, fog effects, night sky with stars)
2. **Middle Layer**: Implement a field of responsive amber/orange ember particles that float throughout the space
3. **Foreground Layer**: Design illuminated interactive elements and content containers that stand out against the darkness

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep blues (#1A1E26, #232B38) and charcoals (#2D2D2D, #1D1D1D)
- **Secondary**: Amber (#FF9E2C), gold (#E6C200), and warm orange (#F15A29) for ember effects
- **Accent**: Silver/white highlights (#E8E8E8, #F5F5F5) for moonlight effects
- **Implement** color transitions between sections to represent emotional shifts

### Typography
- Use a combination of a serif font for headings (something like "Cormorant Gaunt") and a clean sans-serif for body text
- Create custom CSS for headlines that gives them a subtle glow effect, as if illuminated from within
- Ensure body text maintains high readability against dark backgrounds (min contrast ratio 4.5:1)

## Homepage and User Experience

### Initial Landing Experience
- Create a minimal scene showing two silhouettes standing hand-in-hand against a dark, foggy backdrop
- Implement a single, pulsing ember particle floating between them
- Require user interaction (click/touch) with this ember to "ignite" the full experience
- Add subtle text prompt: "Touch the ember to begin the journey"

### Main Navigation: "The Path"
Implement a journey-based navigation with four main sections:
1. "The Meeting Point" - representing beginnings
2. "The Crucible" - representing challenges overcome
3. "Side By Side" - representing commitment
4. "Eternal Light" - representing enduring love

Each section should be accessible via a navigation element designed as intertwining paths of light.

## Interactive Elements

### Ember Particle System
- Implement a JavaScript particle system where ember particles flow around the cursor
- When hovering over interactive elements, particles should gather and intensify
- On click interactions, create momentary "ignition" effects where embers burst and reform
- Optimize particle count based on device performance

### Weather Transition System
- Program gradual transitions between environmental elements (rain, fog, moonlight)
- Create trigger points where user actions change weather effects
- Ensure weather effects are always present but vary in intensity

### Responsive Design
- Design a vertical scrolling experience for mobile that preserves the emotional journey
- Create simplified particle effects for lower-performance devices
- Implement touch-optimized interactions for all interactive elements
- Ensure accessibility compliance while maintaining the atmospheric experience

## Section-Specific Requirements

### "The Meeting Point" Section
- Create animations of two light sources finding each other in darkness
- Implement a gentle rain effect with moonlight breaking through clouds
- Design an animation of two silhouettes meeting with a burst of light at contact point
- Display song lyrics that appear as if being written by an invisible hand
- Include a brief narrative about beginnings and first connections

### "The Crucible" Section
- Intensify the ember particle effects in this section
- Create a visual metaphor of walking through flame together using CSS/JS animations
- Implement a parallax scrolling effect for depth as users move through content
- Display song lyrics that appear and fade like smoke
- Include content about overcoming challenges together

### "Side By Side" Section
- Create a split-screen effect showing complementary imagery
- Animate hands reaching toward each other across the divide
- Implement mirrored weather effects on both sides of the split screen
- Display lyrics that appear simultaneously on both sides
- Include content about partnership and commitment

### "Eternal Light" Section
- Transform the background into a field of stars/lights against the dark backdrop
- Create an animation of two flames joining to create a brighter light
- Implement a countdown timer for the "coming soon" feature designed as a gradually brightening light
- Display lyrics that reveal upcoming information
- Include a newsletter signup form for updates

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or React)
- Canvas API for particle effects
- Web Audio API for ambient sound (optional)
- Responsive design principles
- Progressive enhancement

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement progressive loading of high-quality effects
- Create an initial simplified version that evolves into the full experience
- Add device capability detection to adjust particle counts and effects
- Optimize all images and assets for web delivery
- Implement lazy loading for content below the fold

### Optional Audio Features
- Create a subtle ambient soundtrack that evolves between sections
- Add gentle sound effects for interactions (ember bursts, etc.)
- Include toggleable music previews from actual songs at key points
- Always include a mute button and respect user preferences

## Project Deliverables
1. Complete responsive website with all specified sections and effects
2. Well-commented, organized code
3. Optimized assets for web delivery
4. Documentation for maintaining and updating the site
5. Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Launch Features
- Newsletter signup functionality
- Social media integration
- Countdown timer to album/content release
- Contact form
