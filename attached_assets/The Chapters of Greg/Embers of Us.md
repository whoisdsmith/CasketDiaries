# Embers of Us

We've been to and through hell together and all I know is that, I'm thankful we never left each other behind.

I remember a few times we lost our way,
and our bodies wanted to travel in separate directions,
but the love in our hearts never let us stray from the same path.

Hell might feel like home to others,
but it's no place for us.
but it's no place for us.
So if someday you feel that's where you belong, I would burn up everyday, just to be with you.
just to be with you.
