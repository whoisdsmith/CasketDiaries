# Cemetery Weather

Gray skies bleed on Riverside, another day, another stone
But this one's new, the inscription fresh, a life we barely known
Jensen, our boy, taken too soon, left us drowning in the storm
Now she's gone too, a different kind of loss, tearing me apart, keeping me warm.

Cemetery weather, chills me to the bone
Just like the silence hanging heavy in our home
Promises broken, a love left to decay
Another black rose on your grave, I whisper "Stay."

I see your face in every crowd, hear your laughter in the rain
Remember the girl in the Yellowcard shirt, a love I thought would never wane
But the cracks appeared, whispers of doubt, and a wolf howling at our door
You sought escape in another's arms, leaving me shattered on the floor.

Cemetery weather, chills me to the bone
Just like the silence hanging heavy in our home
Promises broken, a love left to decay
Another black rose on your grave, I whisper "Stay."

Now I walk the line between darkness and the light
A reaper's shadow, a protector in the night
Haunted by your memory, the ghost of what we were
A love story ending in the cemetery, a constant, dull, familiar blur.

Cemetery weather, chills me to the bone
Just like the silence hanging heavy in our home
Promises broken, a love left to decay
Another black rose on your grave, I whisper "Stay."

Stay with me, Sadie, in this graveyard of regret
Where the rain falls endless, and the sun we haven't met
Stay with me, Sadie, in this hollow, haunted space
Where love's a broken promise, and I can't see your face.

Remember when we said
We'd be buried together
In the cemetery weather?
Remember when we said
We'd be buried together
In the cemetery weather?
