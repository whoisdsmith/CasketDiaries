# 816

This last letter I write, dear Sadie, my love,
Do you still feel my voice, a whisper above?
Are you smiling more now, with your world anew?
Does it glow warmer since you faded from view?
When you're alone, does my memory remain?
Did you find peace, or do shadows still stain?
Are you free from regret, or haunted by doubt,
Do you recall those nights we shut the world out?

Looking back now, would you change what we had?
Would you rewrite our pages, erasing the bad?
I'd live it all over, each joy, every scar,
But I'm lost in this memory, you feel so far.

Baby, forgive me, it's taken this long,
The words weren't perfect; I got them wrong.
Say this is fiction, say it's a lie,
Say you're still here, just one more goodbye.
But this house feels colder, our love out of reach,
I'm a ghost in our story, haunting each speech.
Please wake me, hold me, take me back in,
I'm slipping away, where the darkness begins.

Do you recall that November night chill,
Your kiss held me captive, time standing still?
If you could rewind, would you hold on tight,
Or leave me alone in this endless night?
I'll love you forever, through breath and through bone,
Even in silence, even alone.
I'm sorry I faltered, I'm sorry I'm late,
You wanted a song, so I sing of our fate.

Looking back now, would you change what we had?
Would you rewrite our pages, erasing the bad?
I'd live it all over, each joy, every scar,
But I'm lost in this memory, you feel so far.

Baby, forgive me, it's taken this long,
The words weren't perfect; I got them wrong.
Say this is fiction, say it's a lie,
Say you're still here, just one more goodbye.
But this house feels colder, our love out of reach,
I'm a ghost in our story, haunting each speech.
Please wake me, hold me, take me back in,
I'm slipping away, where the darkness begins.

Back in Marshall, at eight sixteen,
Our life replays like a broken screen.
Tell me it's a coma, a trick of the mind,
That I'll wake up to find you, love, one last time.
I see you with him, and I'm here all alone,
A stranger to our story, to the life we'd grown.
None of this is real, it just can't be right,
I'm trapped in this dream, lost to the night.
