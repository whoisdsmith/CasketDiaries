# Gray Yellowcard Shirt

Gray Yellowcard shirt, jeans, black boots, your smile so bright
Erased the darkness, filled my world with light
Stomach in knots, heart beatin' out of my chest
Like a high school crush, you put' me to the test

We built a life together, a love that's true and deep
Every moment with you, a promise I will keep

You were an angel, halo glowin' in the dark
Turned this broken heart into a work of art
First kiss under the streetlights, you asked, I couldn't resist
Now I'm lost in your eyes, a love I can't dismiss

Five years later, and the feeling's still the same
You're the sun in my sky, the whisper of my name
Through the storms and the sunshine, you're always by my side
My best friend, my lover, you're everything I want in this life

We built a life together, a love that's true and deep
Every moment with you, a promise I will keep

You were an angel, halo glowin' in the dark
Turned this broken heart into a work of art
First kiss under the streetlights, you asked, I couldn't resist
Now I'm lost in your eyes, a love I can't dismiss

Remember that first night, the way you held my hand?
In my car in the parking lot, I played all my favorite jams
We were two souls colliding, like stars igniting in the sky
Lost in the moment, in that Alero, I've never felt so high

You were an angel, halo glowin' in the dark
Turned this broken heart into a work of art
First kiss under the streetlights, you asked, I couldn't resist
Now I'm lost in your eyes, a love I can't dismiss
