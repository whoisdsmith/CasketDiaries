# Cemetery Souls

Rain falls on the headstones, gray skies weep like me
Standing by your absence, a love I can't set free
Remember whispers in the dark, promises we made
Now the silence screams your name, a love that slowly decayed

Sadie, the ghost of you still haunts these empty rooms
A melody of what we were, echoing through the gloom
Cemetery weather in my soul, a constant, chilling rain
The day you walked away, I died, and Skully rose me from the grave

I see your face in every crowd, a phantom in the night
Your laughter in the wind, a whisper lost to light
The warmth of your hand in mine, a memory I can't erase
But I'm a ghost to you now, lost in this spectral space

Sadie, the ghost of you still haunts these empty rooms
A melody of what we were, echoing through the gloom
Cemetery weather in my soul, a constant, chilling rain
The day you walked away, I died, and Skully rose me from the grave

The world moves on around me, but I'm frozen in the past,
A love that bled so softly, now a wound that will forever last.
Each breath I take is heavier, your absence fills the night,
A fading ember in the dark now lost to the dying light.

The cruelest thing about this death
Is watching you continue to move on
Your smile still lights up the rooms
Even brighter now that I am gone
The worst part of being dead
Is knowing that you're fine
I don't exist in your memories,
Yet you are haunting all of mine.
