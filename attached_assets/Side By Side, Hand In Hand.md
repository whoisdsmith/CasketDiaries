# Side By Side, Hand In Hand

Whatever Hell lies ahead,
I'll be there fighting every demon with you.
side by side, hand in hand
there are no battles we can't get through
That pull of gravity between you and me
shifts the earth, binds the moon to the sea
Every time we come into contact,
I want to pull you close and love the shit out of you

Out of all the things you love
you always leave yourself off that list
Stop wasting your life in places where people don't see you exist
Out of all the things you love
you always leave yourself off that list
Stop wasting your life in places where people don't see you exist
