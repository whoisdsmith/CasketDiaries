# A Love That Burns Forever

And though the scars remain, they carry on, day by day
Holding onto the fragments, finding strength along the way
For even in the darkness, a single spark can ignite
A love that burns forever, a beacon in the night

The screen flickers blue, another year gone by
Their words on the wall, a digital lullaby
Lonely echoes of bravado, a heart on the mend
Then Sadie's name appears, a new story begins

And suddenly the colors shift, from grayscale to gold
They're laughing in the sunlight, a story yet untold
Holding onto hope, a fragile kind of grace
In her eyes, he sees a future, a love he can embrace

Finding Sadie in November, a flicker in the dark
The promise of forever, a love that left its mark
But shadows still linger, a whisper in the night
Can he outrun the darkness, can he hold onto the light?

A ring on Valentine's Day, a baby on the way
They're building a new life, trying to keep the ghosts at bay
But life's a fickle lover, a cruel and twisted game
And the darkness whispers back, calling them by name

The laughter fades to silence, the joy begins to wane
They fight to keep their grip, but the storm is coming, the rain
Whispers of "what if" and "why him," the guilt, the fear, the shame
Another soul lost too soon, another love in vain

Finding peace in the wreckage, searching for a way to mend
The weight of the world on their shoulders, a journey with no end
She screams into the void, but the silence screams louder still
Can love bloom in the ruins, can hope survive the kill?

They visit a grave, adorned with toys and faded flowers
The ghost of a memory, a love lost in the darkest hours
"I'm sorry," she whispers, tears falling like the rain
"We'll find you again someday, my son, no more pain."
